# Description of the Model
This is a 0D EBM model, which is based on multiple types of introductory texts. The model assumes no atmospheric layers and provides an output of the surface temperature of the earth based on different values of emissivity and albedo. 

It follows the following equation:

T= ((1 - α) S₀ / 4 ε σ)^1/4 

T: Surface Temperature of the Earth

α: Albedo

S₀: Solar Constant

ε: Emissivity

σ: Stefan-Boltzmann constant
